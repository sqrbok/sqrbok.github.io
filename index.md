# Software Quality and Reliability

Course handbook for two complementary programs:

- **SQR** — Software Quality & Reliability (Bachelor)
- **QAM** — Quality Assurance & Management (Master, extends SQR with advanced topics)

These notes cover the full arc from quality theory and measurement through verification techniques and non-functional attributes, grounded in industry practice and current research. The goal is to equip students with the concepts and tools to build quality into a software project from the start — not to inspect it in at the end.

The content reflects current industry practice: continuous integration, automated quality gates, site reliability engineering, and modern code review workflows sit alongside classical foundations. Material is regularly revised to incorporate findings from recent empirical software engineering research.

## Overview

**Course topic map** covers the full scope of both courses across four areas: defining quality, organizing quality assurance, verification methods, and quality attributes. Topics marked in yellow are planned for future editions.

**Quality assurance in the development lifecycle** maps course topics onto a modern CI-based development process. The diagram shows where each technique fits: static analysis and unit tests run automatically on every commit; code reviews and integration tests gate the build pipeline; and non-functional attributes — maintainability, reliability, performance, security, usability — are evaluated before release. Students are expected to apply these practices within a CI workflow, treating quality gates as first-class engineering artifacts rather than end-of-cycle activities.

## Areas Covered

### 1. [Defining Quality](/content/define/)
Quality views, quality models, and the metrics that make quality measurable and comparable across projects and teams.

### 2. [Organizing Quality](/content/organization/)
Cost of quality, project-level quality planning, process improvement, and the standards and industry practices that operationalise these — CMMI, ISO 9000, TMMi, DevOps, SRE, PSP/TSP.

### 3. [Verification and Validation](/content/verif/)
The full range of V&V methods and when to apply each:
- Black-box testing: domain and boundary analysis, equivalence partitioning, decision tables, classification trees, combinatorial, random and property-based, exploratory testing, operational profiles
- White-box testing: statement, branch, MC/DC, and data-flow coverage; mutation testing
- Inspection: code reviews, Fagan inspection, reading techniques
- Static analysis: model checking, symbolic execution, dataflow analysis, tooling

### 4. [Quality Attributes](/content/attributes/)
Maintainability, reliability, performance and queuing theory, security, and usability — each treated as an engineering property with models, metrics, and design implications.

### 5. [Selected Materials](/content/material/)
Curated textbooks and key research papers, one annotation per entry explaining the core contribution and why it earns a place in the list.
