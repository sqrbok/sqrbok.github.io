## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Principles

1. **Atomic & Self-Contained**
   - Each page should cover ONE topic or method
   - Include all necessary context and references
   - Don't assume readers have read other pages

2. **Source Everything**
   - Cite original authors and frameworks
   - Provide links to academic papers or authoritative sources
   - Use IEEE citation style (handled by jekyll-scholar)
   - Place sources near the title OR in a dedicated Sources section at the end

3. **Practical Focus**
   - Move beyond theory to application
   - Include examples, checklists, or decision rules
   - Explain WHEN to use (and when NOT to use) a method

4. **Appropriate Length**
   - Short methods: 100-180 lines
   - Medium topics: 170-250 lines
   - Comparative analyses: 200-300 lines
   - If longer, consider splitting into multiple pages

5. **Visual Support**
   - Use Mermaid diagrams for processes and flows
   - Use tables for comparisons
   - Keep visuals simple and focused

### Quality Standards

- **Accuracy:** All facts and claims must be verifiable
- **Clarity:** Write for students and practitioners
- **Attribution:** Acknowledge original sources and authors
- **Consistency:** Follow existing page structure and style
- **Neutrality:** Present multiple perspectives when applicable

## Adding New Content

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing content** - Avoid duplicating existing pages
2. **Choose the right template** - Method vs. Analysis
3. **Gather sources** - Have citations ready before writing
4. **Pick a topic area** - Determine which section (define, organization, verif, attributes, material, template)

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Use the Template

Copy the appropriate template:
```bash
# For a method description
cp templates/method-template.md content/[section]/[your-topic].md

# For an analysis paper
cp templates/analysis-template.md content/[section]/[your-topic].md
```

#### 2. Fill in the Front Matter

```yaml
---
parent: Section Name  # e.g., "Defining Quality", "Verification and Validation"
title: Your Page Title
nav_order: X  # Check existing pages in that section
layout: default
---
```

#### 3. Write Your Content

- Follow the template structure
- Include sources/citations
- Add examples and practical guidance
- Keep it focused and atomic

#### 4. Add Visual Elements (Optional)

**Mermaid diagrams:**
````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Start] --> B[Process]
    B --> C[End]
```
````

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data     | Data     |
```

#### 5. Test Locally

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Visit http://localhost:4000 to preview
```

#### 6. Submit Pull Request

- **Title:** Clear, descriptive (e.g., "Add: Boundary value testing description")
- **Description:**
  - What you're adding
  - Why it's valuable
  - Any sources/references used
  - Confirmation you've tested locally

### Markdown Conventions

- **Headings:** Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections

  **Note:** Important information here.
  ```

### Citations

- Place full citation near title OR in dedicated "Sources" section
- Format: Author, Title, Publisher, Year, ISBN/URL
- Example:
  ```markdown
  **Source:** Pezze, Mauro, and Michal Young, _Software Testing and Analysis: Process, Principles, and Techniques_. Wiley, 2008. ISBN-13: 978-0471455936.
