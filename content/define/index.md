# Defining Quality

Understanding what quality means in software is fundamental to achieving it. Quality is multifaceted—it depends on perspectives, contexts, and stakeholder needs.

---

## Why Quality Matters

Software quality directly impacts:
- **User satisfaction** - Poor quality frustrates users and damages reputation
- **Business value** - Quality issues cost time, money, and opportunities
- **Safety and reliability** - In critical systems, quality can be a matter of life and death
- **Maintainability** - Quality code is easier to understand, modify, and extend

The cost of poor quality grows exponentially as defects propagate through the development lifecycle. A defect found in production can be 100x more expensive to fix than one caught during requirements.

## What is Quality?

Quality is not a single concept but rather depends on multiple perspectives:

### Transcendental View
Quality as innate excellence—you know it when you see it, but it's hard to define precisely.

### User View
Quality as **fitness for purpose**—does the software meet user needs and expectations?

### Manufacturing View
Quality as **conformance to specification**—does the software match its requirements?

### Product View
Quality tied to inherent product characteristics—measurable internal attributes like complexity, coupling, and cohesion.

### Value-Based View
Quality as worth or benefit relative to cost—balancing quality with constraints.

## Key Principles

1. **Quality is multidimensional** - No single metric captures all aspects of quality
2. **Quality costs** - But poor quality costs more
3. **Quality requires measurement** - You can't improve what you don't measure
4. **Quality is everyone's responsibility** - Not just QA's job
5. **Prevention beats detection** - Build quality in, don't inspect it in
