# Defining Quality

Understanding what quality means in software is fundamental to achieving it. Quality is multifaceted—it depends on perspectives, contexts, and stakeholder needs.

---

## Why Quality Matters

Software quality directly impacts:
- **User satisfaction** - Poor quality frustrates users and damages reputation
- **Business value** - Quality issues cost time, money, and opportunities
- **Safety and reliability** - In critical systems, quality can be a matter of life and death
- **Maintainability** - Quality code is easier to understand, modify, and extend

The cost of poor quality grows exponentially as defects propagate through the development lifecycle. A defect found in production can be 100x more expensive to fix than one caught during requirements.

## What is Quality?

Quality is not a single concept but rather depends on multiple perspectives:

### Transcendental View
Quality as innate excellence—you know it when you see it, but it's hard to define precisely.

### User View
Quality as **fitness for purpose**—does the software meet user needs and expectations?

### Manufacturing View
Quality as **conformance to specification**—does the software match its requirements?

### Product View
Quality tied to inherent product characteristics—measurable internal attributes like complexity, coupling, and cohesion.

### Value-Based View
Quality as worth or benefit relative to cost—balancing quality with constraints.

### [Importance of Quality](importance.md)

Understand why software quality matters and the real-world consequences of quality failures.

### [Foundations](foundations/)

Explore fundamental concepts and perspectives on quality:

- **[Views](foundations/views.md)** - Five perspectives on quality (Garvin)
- **[Models](foundations/models.md)** - Structured frameworks (ISO 25010, McCall, Kano)
- **[Gurus](foundations/gurus.md)** - Quality pioneers and their contributions

### [Measurement](measurement/)

Learn how to quantify and track quality:

- **[Definitions](measurement/definitions.md)** - What makes a good metric?
- **[Types](measurement/types.md)** - Product, process, and resource metrics
- **[Examples](measurement/examples.md)** - LOC, complexity, defect density
- **[Development](measurement/development.md)** - Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach
- **[Pitfalls](measurement/pitfalls.md)** - Common measurement mistakes

## Key Principles

1. **Quality is multidimensional** - No single metric captures all aspects of quality
2. **Quality costs** - But poor quality costs more
3. **Quality requires measurement** - You can't improve what you don't measure
4. **Quality is everyone's responsibility** - Not just QA's job
5. **Prevention beats detection** - Build quality in, don't inspect it in
