## Metric Decomposition

### Maintainability

Maintainability can be broken down into several key sub-metrics:

1. **Correctability**:  
   - Measures how easy it is to fix faults in the software.  
   - Includes sub-metrics like:  
     - **Faults count**: Number of faults found.  
     - **Closure time**: Time taken to close a fault.  
     - **Isolate/Fix time**: Time spent diagnosing versus fixing issues.  
     - **Fault rate**: Faults per 1,000 lines of code.

2. **Effort**:  
   - Measures the resources required to make corrections or improvements.  
   - Includes:  
     - **Resource prediction**: Estimating the effort required.  
     - **Effort expenditure**: Actual resources spent.

3. **Testability**:  
   - Focuses on the extent and quality of testing.  
   - Sub-metrics include:  
     - **Degree of testing**: E.g., statement coverage and test plan completeness.  
     - **Effort**: Resources spent on testing.

4. **Expandability**:  
   - Measures how easily changes can be made to the software.  
   - Includes:  
     - **Effort**: Time or resources for implementing changes.  
     - **Change counts**: Number of modifications.  
     - **Change effort**: Average effort per change.  
     - **Change size**: Volume of code modified.

## Object-Oriented Metrics

When working with object-oriented programming, several key metrics help evaluate software quality:

1. **Number of Methods per Class**: Indicates the complexity of a class.  
2. **Depth of Inheritance Tree**: Measures how deeply a class is inherited.  
3. **Number of Child Classes**: Tracks the number of subclasses for a class.  
4. **Coupling Between Object Classes**: Evaluates how interconnected different classes are.  
5. **Calls to Methods in Unrelated Classes**: Measures the extent of cross-class interactions.

## Maintainability Index

### Definition

The **Maintainability Index** is a single number representing the maintainability of code, calculated using:

Maintainability Index = MAX(0, (171 -  
      5.2 * log(Halstead Volume) -  
      0.23 * (Cyclomatic Complexity) -  
      16.2 * log(Lines of Code)) * 100 / 171)

Where:
- **Halstead Volume** relates to the complexity of code based on distinct operators and operands.  
- **Cyclomatic Complexity** measures the number of independent paths through a program’s code.  
- **LOC** refers to Lines of Code.

### Origins

The Maintainability Index was introduced in 1992 by Paul Oman and Jack Hagemeister. It was based on statistical regression analysis across various metrics in systems coded in C and Pascal.

### Practical Use

- Low values (close to 0) indicate hard-to-maintain code.
- High values (approaching 171) suggest well-structured, maintainable code.

### Design Considerations

From Microsoft’s design rationale:
- If the index shows **red**, it indicates a high likelihood of maintainability issues.
- The focus is on identifying problematic areas with a high degree of confidence.


> "We noticed that as code tended toward 0 it was clearly hard to maintain code and the difference between code at 0 and some negative value was not useful."

> "The desire was that if the index showed red then we would be saying with a high degree of confidence that there was an issue with the code."

## Examples of Commonly Used Automated Metrics

### Development Metrics:
- **Lines of Code (LOC)**: A simple yet widely used productivity metric.  
- **Test Coverage**: Ensures the completeness of tests, with variants like line coverage or branch coverage.  
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Highlights potential maintenance issues by measuring complexity.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Response Time**: Measures how quickly the system responds to user requests.  
- **Throughput**: The number of transactions or tasks handled in a given time.

### Reliability Metrics:
- **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)**: Average time until a failure occurs.  
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: Time taken to recover from failures.

### Security Metrics:
- **Code Reviews**: Evaluating adherence to security practices like input validation and secure coding standards.  
- **Static Analysis Tools**: E.g., Bandit, Snyk, used for automated security checks.

### Maintainability Metrics:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Again used to assess maintainability.  
- **Tech Debt**: Metrics like SQALE and SONAR evaluate technical debt.  
- **Dependency Analysis**: Helps to understand and manage code dependencies and change impacts using methods like Design Structure Matrix.


## Example: ISO 25002 Attributes-Metrics Mapping

In software engineering, quality attributes such as **reliability**, **usability**, or **maintainability** require **metrics** to measure the extent to which these attributes are present in a system. Metrics allow us to analyze quality during development and validate it during release.
