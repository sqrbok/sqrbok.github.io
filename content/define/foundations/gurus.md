## Noriaki Kano (1940– )

### Contributions:
- **Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction**: {% cite kano1984attractive %}
  - Identifies how different features affect customer satisfaction.
  - Categorizes product attributes into:
    - **Must-Haves**: Basic needs. Lack of these causes dissatisfaction.
    - **Satisfiers**: Features that increase satisfaction as they improve.
    - **Delighters**: Unexpected features that excite and delight customers.
- **Emphasis on Satisfiers**:
  - Satisfiers bridge the gap between basic needs and delight. These features require incremental investment but directly enhance customer satisfaction.
