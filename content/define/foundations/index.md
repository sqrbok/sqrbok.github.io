# Foundations of Quality

Before we can measure or improve quality, we must first understand what quality means. Quality is not a single, simple concept—it has multiple dimensions, perspectives, and interpretations that have evolved over decades of thought and practice.

---

## What is Quality?

The definition of quality varies depending on who you ask and what context you're in:

- **To a user**: Quality means the software works reliably and meets their needs
- **To a developer**: Quality means clean, maintainable code with good architecture
- **To a business**: Quality means customer satisfaction and reduced support costs
- **To a regulator**: Quality means compliance with standards and safety requirements

None of these perspectives is wrong—they're all valid views of quality that must be balanced and understood.

## Why Understanding Quality Matters

A solid foundation in quality concepts enables you to:

- **Communicate effectively** - Speak the same language as stakeholders with different perspectives
- **Make better decisions** - Choose the right quality attributes to prioritize
- **Set clear goals** - Define what "good enough" means for your specific context
- **Evaluate approaches** - Assess quality models and frameworks critically
- **Build consensus** - Align diverse stakeholders around shared quality objectives

## Topics in This Section

### [Views of Quality](views.md)
David Garvin's five perspectives on quality:
- **Transcendent view** - Quality as excellence and innate superiority
- **Product-based view** - Quality as measurable attributes
- **User-based view** - Quality as fitness for purpose
- **Manufacturing view** - Quality as conformance to specifications
- **Value-based view** - Quality as cost and price considerations

### [Quality Models](models.md)
Structured frameworks for understanding quality dimensions:
- **Garvin's 8 dimensions** - Performance, features, reliability, conformance, durability, serviceability, aesthetics, perceived quality
- **ISO/IEC 25010** - Functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, portability
- **Kano Model** - Must-be, performance, and delighter quality attributes
- **McCall's Quality Model** - Product operation, revision, and transition factors

### [Quality Gurus](gurus.md)
Thought leaders who shaped quality management:
- **Walter Shewhart** - Statistical process control, PDCA cycle
- **W. Edwards Deming** - 14 points for management, systems thinking
- **Joseph Juran** - Quality trilogy (planning, control, improvement)
- **Philip Crosby** - Zero defects, quality is free
- **Noriaki Kano** - Kano model of customer satisfaction

## From Foundations to Practice

Understanding these foundational concepts prepares you for practical application:

1. **Different perspectives reveal different priorities** - The transcendent view values craftsmanship; the value-based view considers cost-effectiveness
2. **Quality models provide structure** - Systematic frameworks ensure comprehensive quality assessment
3. **Historical context matters** - Quality gurus developed approaches in specific industries and eras, but their principles remain relevant

## The Evolution of Quality Thinking

Quality management has evolved through distinct eras:

**1920s-1950s: Inspection Era**
- Focus on detecting defects after production
- Statistical quality control emerges (Shewhart)
- Quality as conformance to specifications

**1950s-1980s: Quality Control Era**
- Prevention over detection
- Total Quality Management (TQM)
- Quality as continuous improvement (Deming, Juran)

**1980s-2000s: Quality Assurance Era**
- Process-focused approach
- ISO standards and certification
- Quality built into processes

**2000s-Present: Total Quality Era**
- Quality as business strategy
- Customer-centric quality
- Agile and continuous delivery
- Quality as everyone's responsibility

## Key Insights

### Quality is Multidimensional
No single metric or perspective captures all aspects of quality. A product can excel in some dimensions (e.g., performance) while being poor in others (e.g., usability).

### Quality is Contextual
What constitutes "high quality" depends on:
- Industry and domain (safety-critical vs. consumer apps)
- User expectations and needs
- Competitive landscape
- Resource constraints
- Regulatory requirements

### Quality is Relative
Quality is often judged in comparison to:
- Alternatives and competitors
- Previous versions
- Standards and benchmarks
- User expectations

### Quality Requires Trade-offs
Improving one quality dimension may negatively impact another:
- Performance vs. maintainability
- Security vs. usability
- Feature richness vs. simplicity
- Time-to-market vs. reliability
