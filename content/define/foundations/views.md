David A. Garvin {% cite garvin_what_1984 %} identifies five key perspectives on quality. These views help organizations assess and improve quality in various contexts. Each perspective offers a unique lens for understanding quality.

## 1. **Transcendent View** ✨
- **Definition**: Quality is absolute and universally recognizable but cannot be precisely defined. Often associated with excellence or "innate goodness."
- **Example**: A luxury watch like a Rolex or a fine piece of art is recognized as high quality because of its superior craftsmanship and prestige.
- **Criticism**: Subjective and difficult to measure or operationalize.

## 2. **Product-Based View** 🏅
- **Definition**: Quality is a precise and measurable variable based on product attributes. More features or better performance equals higher quality.
- **Example**: A smartphone with better resolution, longer battery life, and faster processing speed is considered higher quality.
- **Criticism**: Assumes that all product improvements are desirable, ignoring trade-offs like cost or customer needs.

## 3. **User-Based View** 👥
- **Definition**: Quality is determined by the extent to which a product or service satisfies customer needs and preferences.
- **Example**: A budget-friendly car like a Toyota Corolla is high quality to a customer who values reliability and low maintenance.
- **Criticism**: Highly subjective and dependent on individual expectations, which can vary widely.

## 4. **Manufacturing-Based View** 🏭
- **Definition**: Quality is defined as conformance to specifications or the degree to which a product or service is free from defects.
- **Example**: A car produced with zero defects in the assembly line meets this definition of quality.
- **Criticism**: Focuses on efficiency and internal consistency but overlooks customer satisfaction and other external factors.

## 5. **Value-Based View** 💰
- **Definition**: Quality is the balance between performance and cost, where a product or service delivers the most value for its price.
- **Example**: A budget airline ticket that meets customer expectations for basic transportation at a low price.
- **Criticism**: Overemphasis on cost-performance trade-offs can lead to compromises in safety or long-term durability.
