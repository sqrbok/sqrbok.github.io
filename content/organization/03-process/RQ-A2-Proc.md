## Sample Exam Questions with Model Answers

### Question 1
*A software team consistently delivers projects late. Management responds by requiring overtime. Three months later, two key developers quit and projects are even later. Using the concepts from this lecture, explain what went wrong and what should have been done instead.*

**Model Answer:**
- Management chose "Working Harder" instead of "Working Smarter"
- This created a capability trap: overtime led to burnout, turnover, and capability erosion
- Double-loop learning was needed: analyze WHY projects are late (estimation? scope creep? testing bottleneck?)
- Should have tolerated the "worse-before-better" dip to invest in process improvement
- Reference: Repenning & Sterman (2001) capability dynamics

---

### Question 2
*Explain why only 12.5% of organizations successfully implement process improvement, using Pfeffer's One-Eighth Rule.*

**Model Answer:**
Three filters reduce success rate:
1. **Belief filter (50%):** Only half believe the evidence connecting practices to results
2. **Systemic filter (50%):** Only half try comprehensive change vs. isolated fixes
3. **Persistence filter (50%):** Only half persist through the "worse-before-better" phase

Result: 50% × 50% × 50% = 12.5% succeed

---

### Question 3
*A code review queue has become a bottleneck. Apply the Theory of Constraints Five Focusing Steps to solve this problem.*

**Model Answer:**
1. **Identify:** Code review is the constraint (PRs waiting 3+ days)
2. **Exploit:** Prioritize critical path reviews, batch small changes
3. **Subordinate:** Developers submit smaller PRs, limit WIP
4. **Elevate:** Train more reviewers, add automated linting
5. **Repeat:** If testing becomes the new bottleneck, start over

---

### Question 4
*What is the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 in CMMI?*

**Model Answer:**
- **Level 1 (Initial):** Processes are ad hoc; success depends on individual heroics; processes abandoned under stress; cannot repeat successes
- **Level 2 (Managed):** Project-level process control; practices are planned, performed, and measured; **key difference: practices are retained during stress**; work is visible at milestones

---

### Question 5
*Why is management commitment ranked as the #1 critical success factor for SPI?*

**Model Answer:**
- Resources allocation depends on management support
- Without champions, improvement time is lost to "firefighting"
- Managers must model desired behaviors
- Cultural change requires visible leadership commitment
- Research consistently shows this as #1 factor across ITIL, Six Sigma, and Lean studies

---

### Question 6
*List all Level 2 CMMI Process Areas and explain why "practices retained under stress" is the key differentiator from Level 1.*

**Model Answer:**
Level 2 Process Areas (7 total):
1. **REQM** - Requirements Management
2. **PP** - Project Planning
3. **PMC** - Project Monitoring and Control
4. **SAM** - Supplier Agreement Management
5. **MA** - Measurement and Analysis
6. **PPQA** - Process and Product Quality Assurance
7. **CM** - Configuration Management

"Practices retained under stress" is the key differentiator because:
- Level 1 organizations abandon processes when facing pressure (deadlines, budget constraints)
- Level 2 organizations maintain discipline even during crises
- This means Level 2 can reproduce past successes while Level 1 cannot
- The difference is not in having processes, but in **following them consistently**

---

### Question 7
*An organization wants to move from CMMI Level 3 to Level 4. What is the key transition and which Process Areas must be implemented?*

**Model Answer:**
**Key Transition:** From qualitative to quantitative management
- Level 3 uses defined processes with qualitative assessment
- Level 4 requires statistical process control and fact-based decision making

**New Process Areas at Level 4:**
1. **OPP** (Organizational Process Performance) - Establish and maintain organizational process performance baselines
2. **QPM** (Quantitative Project Management) - Quantitatively manage the project to achieve quality and process performance objectives

**What Changes:**
- Decisions must be based on statistical data, not just expert judgment
- Process performance baselines established and maintained
- Special causes of variation identified and addressed
- Quality measures incorporated into decision-making repository
