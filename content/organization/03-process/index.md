# Process Improvement

Software Process Improvement (SPI) is a systematic approach to enhancing organizational performance through deliberate modification of technical, organizational, and cultural structures.

---

## Why Process Improvement?

Organizations pursue process improvement for several interconnected reasons:

- **Operational failures** - Recurring bugs, quality escapes, customer complaints
- **Competitive pressure** - Faster time-to-market, better quality than competitors
- **Predictability** - Ability to estimate and deliver on commitments
- **Cultural change** - Moving from heroics to disciplined engineering

The key insight is that **organizational failure precedes physical failure** - improving processes prevents problems rather than just fixing them.

## Key Principles

1. **Culture eats process for breakfast** - Technical changes fail without cultural support
2. **Improvement takes time** - The "worse-before-better" dynamic is normal
3. **Measure to improve** - Data-driven decisions outperform intuition
4. **Double-loop learning** - Question assumptions, not just correct errors
