# Cost of Quality

The Cost of Quality (COQ) framework provides an economic view of quality activities, helping organizations understand quality investments and returns. Quality is not free, but poor quality costs more.

---

## Overview

Cost of Quality includes all costs associated with:
- Preventing defects
- Appraising quality
- Dealing with failures

Understanding these costs enables:
- Better quality investment decisions
- Demonstrating ROI of quality initiatives
- Optimizing quality spending
- Justifying prevention activities

## Topics in This Section

### [Cost Categories](categories.md)

The four categories of quality costs:

- **Prevention Costs** - Costs of preventing defects before they occur
- **Appraisal Costs** - Costs of measuring and monitoring quality
- **Internal Failure Costs** - Costs of defects found before delivery
- **External Failure Costs** - Costs of defects found after delivery

### [Cost-Benefit Analysis](analysis.md)

Evaluating quality investments:

- ROI calculation for quality initiatives
- Trade-off analysis (cost vs. quality level)
- Optimal quality investment levels
- Break-even analysis
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

## Key Principles

### Prevention vs. Detection

The 1-10-100 Rule:
- **$1** to prevent a defect
- **$10** to find and fix during development
- **$100** to fix in production

Investing in prevention yields the highest ROI.

### Quality is Free (Crosby)

Philip Crosby's argument:
- Quality doesn't cost, it pays
- Prevention costs less than failure
- Zero defects is achievable and economical
- Quality is conformance to requirements

### Optimal Quality Level

Not all quality spending is justified:
- Diminishing returns above certain quality levels
- Context-dependent (safety-critical vs. non-critical)
- Balance cost of quality with cost of poor quality

## The Quality Cost Curve

```
Cost
  |
  |        Cost of Poor Quality
  |         /
  |        /
  |       /
  |      /
  |     /    \
  |    /      \  Cost of Prevention + Appraisal
  |   /        \
  |  /          \___
  | /________________\___
  |________________________  Quality Level
  Low            Optimal    Perfection
```

Optimal quality level minimizes total cost.

## Measuring Cost of Quality

### Data Collection

Sources of COQ data:
- Project tracking (time sheets, budgets)
- Defect tracking systems
- Support tickets
- Warranty claims
- Customer satisfaction surveys

### Calculation

```
Total COQ = Prevention + Appraisal + Internal Failure + External Failure

COQ Percentage = (Total COQ / Total Revenue) × 100%
```

Typical COQ ranges:
- World-class: 2-4% of revenue
- Average: 10-15% of revenue
- Poor quality: 20%+ of revenue

## Using COQ for Decision Making

### Justifying Prevention

Show ROI of quality investments:
- Code review program
- Test automation infrastructure
- Training and skill development
- Process improvement initiatives

### Prioritizing Quality Activities

Focus on highest-impact areas:
- Analyze where failures occur most
- Target prevention at root causes
- Optimize appraisal methods
- Reduce failure costs systematically

### Demonstrating Value

Communicate quality value to stakeholders:
- Track COQ trends over time
- Show cost avoidance from prevention
- Calculate savings from quality improvements
- Benchmark against industry norms

## Common Challenges

**Challenge**: Hidden quality costs

**Solution**: Track time spent on rework, support, and firefighting

**Challenge**: Difficulty attributing costs

**Solution**: Use activity-based costing, estimate when exact data unavailable

**Challenge**: Short-term vs. long-term thinking

**Solution**: Show cumulative costs over product lifecycle
