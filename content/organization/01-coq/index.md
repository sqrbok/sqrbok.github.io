# Cost of Quality

The Cost of Software Quality (CoSQ) provides a financial framework for translating technical quality metrics into business vocabulary that executives can use for data-driven decision-making.

---

## Why Cost of Quality?

Quality has costs, but so does poor quality. Understanding these costs enables:

- **Investment justification** - Make the business case for quality initiatives
- **Trade-off analysis** - Balance prevention vs. detection vs. failure costs
- **Resource allocation** - Invest where it has the greatest impact
- **Executive communication** - Speak the language of business

## The Cost of Quality Model

| Category | Type | Examples |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Conformance** | Prevention | Training, reviews, tools, process improvement |
| | Appraisal | Testing, inspections, audits |
| **Nonconformance** | Internal Failure | Rework, retesting, debugging |
| | External Failure | Support, patches, reputation damage |

**Key insight**: Investing in prevention and appraisal reduces total cost by avoiding expensive failures.

---

## Key Principles

1. **The 1:10:100 rule** - Defects cost 10x more at each subsequent phase
2. **Prevention over detection** - It's cheaper to prevent than to find and fix
3. **Measure to manage** - Track quality costs to optimize investment
4. **External failure is most expensive** - Defects found by customers have hidden costs
