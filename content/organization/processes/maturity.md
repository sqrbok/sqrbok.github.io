- Understand current capability
- Identify improvement priorities
- Benchmark against standards
- Plan capability roadmaps
- Demonstrate competence to customers

## Maturity Models

### CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

Five maturity levels:

**Level 1: Initial**
- Ad hoc, unpredictable
- Success depends on individual heroics
- Reactive quality

**Level 2: Managed**
- Project-level management
- Basic planning and tracking
- Requirements and configuration management

**Level 3: Defined**
- Organization-wide processes
- Process standardization
- Proactive quality management

**Level 4: Quantitatively Managed**
- Measured process performance
- Statistical process control
- Quantitative quality management

**Level 5: Optimizing**
- Continuous improvement focus
- Innovation and optimization
- Defect prevention culture
