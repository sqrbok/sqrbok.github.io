# Process Improvement

Process improvement is the systematic approach to enhancing quality capability through continuous learning and adaptation. This page covers key improvement frameworks and techniques.

---

## Overview

Process improvement focuses on:
- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Analyzing root causes
- Implementing changes
- Measuring effectiveness
- Sustaining improvements

---

## Key Topics

### PDCA Cycle (Deming Cycle)

**Plan**: Identify improvement opportunity, analyze current state, develop solution
**Do**: Implement change on small scale (pilot)
**Check**: Measure results, compare to baseline
**Act**: Standardize if successful, or try again

### DMAIC (Six Sigma)

**Define**: Define problem and project scope
**Measure**: Collect baseline data
**Analyze**: Identify root causes
**Improve**: Implement solutions
**Control**: Sustain improvements

### Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

- Small, incremental improvements
- Everyone participates
- Daily improvement culture
- Focus on eliminating waste

### Root Cause Analysis

Techniques for finding true causes:
- 5 Whys analysis
- Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams
- Pareto analysis (80/20 rule)
- Fault tree analysis

### Retrospectives

Learning from project experiences:
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- What will we change?
- Action items and ownership
