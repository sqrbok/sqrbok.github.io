# Quality Processes

Quality processes provide systematic, repeatable approaches to achieving and improving quality. This subsection covers process improvement frameworks, maturity models, and quality auditing.

---

## Overview

Quality processes operate at the organizational level, providing:

- **Consistency** - Standard approaches across projects
- **Repeatability** - Predictable quality outcomes
- **Improvement** - Systematic capability enhancement
- **Scalability** - Quality at scale across the organization

Unlike project-specific quality management, organizational processes provide the foundation and infrastructure for quality across all projects.

## Topics in This Section

### [Process Improvement](improvement.md)

Systematic approaches to enhancing quality capability:

- PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle
- DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control)
- Kaizen and continuous improvement
- Root cause analysis
- Retrospectives and lessons learned

### [Process Maturity](maturity.md)

Assessing and advancing organizational capability:

- Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
- Maturity level assessment
- Process area implementation
- Capability building roadmaps
- Maturity benchmarking

### [Quality Audits](audits.md)

Systematic examination of quality practices:

- Internal audits
- External audits and assessments
- Compliance verification
- Process conformance checking
- Audit planning and execution
- Corrective and preventive actions

---

## Key Principles

### Process Orientation

Focusing on processes, not just people:

- Repeatable processes reduce variability
- Processes can be measured and improved
- Process discipline enables innovation
- People work within processes to deliver quality

### Continuous Improvement

Quality processes are never "done":

- Always seek incremental improvements
- Learn from every project
- Adapt processes to changing contexts
- Benchmark against best practices

### Evidence-Based

Process decisions based on data:

- Measure process performance
- Analyze root causes, not symptoms
- Use statistical process control
- Validate improvement effectiveness

---

## Process Framework

A complete quality process framework includes:

**Preventive Processes**:

- Requirements management
- Design reviews
- Code standards and reviews
- Configuration management

**Detective Processes**:

- Testing at multiple levels
- Static analysis
- Peer reviews
- Quality audits

**Corrective Processes**:

- Defect management
- Root cause analysis
- Process improvement
- Lessons learned

---

## Process Documentation

Essential process artifacts:

- **Process descriptions** - What, why, when, who, how
- **Procedures** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Work instructions** - Detailed guidance
- **Templates and checklists** - Standardized formats
- **Guidelines** - Best practices and recommendations

---

## Process Measurement

Tracking process effectiveness:

**Process Efficiency Metrics**:

- Cycle time
- Throughput
- Resource utilization
- Cost per unit

**Process Effectiveness Metrics**:

- Defect escape rate
- Customer satisfaction
- On-time delivery
- Rework percentage

**Process Maturity Indicators**:

- Process compliance rate
- Process variation
- Process capability indices
- Improvement velocity

---

## Common Process Challenges

**Challenge**: Processes seen as bureaucracy

**Solution**: Keep processes lightweight, show value, involve practitioners in design

**Challenge**: Process compliance without understanding

**Solution**: Train on the "why," not just the "what"; make processes easy to follow

**Challenge**: Processes become outdated

**Solution**: Regular process reviews, adaptation based on feedback, continuous improvement
