# Quality Standards

Quality standards and frameworks provide structured approaches to managing and improving software quality. This subsection covers major quality management standards and methodologies used in the software industry.

---

## Overview

Quality standards provide:
- **Structure** - Organized frameworks for quality management
- **Best practices** - Proven approaches from industry experience
- **Benchmarking** - Common reference points for assessment
- **Certification** - External validation of quality capability
- **Continuous improvement** - Systematic enhancement methods

---

## Topics in This Section

### [CMMI](cmmi.md)

Capability Maturity Model Integration:

- Maturity levels and process areas
- CMMI-DEV for software development
- Appraisal methods
- Implementation roadmaps
- Benefits and challenges

### [ISO 9001](iso9001.md)

International quality management standard:

- Quality management principles
- Requirements and certification
- Document control and procedures
- Management review and improvement
- Application to software development

### [Six Sigma](six_sigma.md)

Data-driven quality improvement methodology:

- DMAIC framework
- Statistical process control
- Defect reduction strategies
- Six Sigma belts and roles
- Lean Six Sigma

---

## Comparing Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Approach | Certification |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **CMMI** | Process maturity | Staged/continuous improvement | Appraisal-based |
| **ISO 9001** | Quality management system | Requirements-based | Third-party audit |
| **Six Sigma** | Defect reduction | Statistical, project-based | Belt certification |

---

## Choosing a Framework

Factors to consider:

**CMMI** when:
- Need process capability assessment
- Government/defense contracts require it
- Want staged maturity progression
- Focus on process standardization

**ISO 9001** when:
- Need internationally recognized certification
- Customers require ISO compliance
- Want quality management system framework
- Focus on documentation and procedures

**Six Sigma** when:
- Want statistical rigor
- Focus on defect reduction
- Need project-based improvements
- Want data-driven culture

---

## Multiple Framework Integration

Organizations often combine frameworks:

- **ISO 9001** as foundation (QMS)
- **CMMI** for process improvement
- **Six Sigma** for specific improvement projects
- **Agile/DevOps** for delivery speed

Integrated approach provides:
- Broader coverage
- Complementary strengths
- Unified quality culture

But requires:
- Careful alignment
- Avoid duplication
- Manage complexity
- Unified governance

---

## Implementation Considerations

### Cost

- Training and education
- External consultants
- Certification/appraisal fees
- Tool and infrastructure
- Ongoing maintenance

### Time

- Typical timelines:
  - ISO 9001: 6-12 months to certification
  - CMMI Level 2/3: 1-2 years
  - Six Sigma deployment: 2-3 years

### Cultural Change

- Process discipline
- Data-driven decisions
- Continuous improvement mindset
- Documentation and formality
- Measurement and accountability

---

## Benefits

- Improved process predictability
- Higher product quality
- Better cost and schedule estimation
- Enhanced customer satisfaction
- Competitive differentiation
- Regulatory compliance
- Reduced business risk

---

## Common Challenges

- Perceived as bureaucratic
- High implementation costs
- Cultural resistance
- Maintenance overhead
- Balancing agility and formality
