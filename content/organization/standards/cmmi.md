# CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

CMMI is a process improvement framework that provides organizations with essential elements of effective processes, helping improve performance and capability.

---

## Overview

CMMI helps organizations:
- Assess current process maturity
- Identify improvement priorities
- Implement best practices
- Measure progress objectively
- Benchmark against industry

---

## Maturity Levels

CMMI defines five maturity levels:

**Level 1: Initial**
- Unpredictable, reactive
- Success depends on individuals
- Ad hoc processes

**Level 2: Managed**
- Managed at project level
- Requirements managed
- Planning and tracking
- Basic process discipline

**Level 3: Defined**
- Proactive, organization-wide
- Processes characterized and understood
- Standards, procedures, tools
- Process improvement

**Level 4: Quantitatively Managed**
- Measured and controlled
- Statistical process control
- Quantitative objectives
- Predictable performance

**Level 5: Optimizing**
- Focus on continuous improvement
- Innovation and optimization
- Causal analysis and resolution
- Organizational learning

## Process Areas (CMMI-DEV v2.0)

Organized by categories:

**Process Management**:
- Organizational Process Definition (OPD)
- Organizational Process Focus (OPF)
- Organizational Training (OT)
- Organizational Process Performance (OPP)
- Organizational Innovation and Deployment (OID)

**Project Management**:
- Project Planning (PP)
- Project Monitoring and Control (PMC)
- Requirements Management (REQM)
- Risk Management (RSKM)
- Integrated Project Management (IPM)
- Quantitative Project Management (QPM)

**Engineering**:
- Requirements Development (RD)
- Technical Solution (TS)
- Product Integration (PI)
- Verification (VER)
- Validation (VAL)

**Support**:
- Configuration Management (CM)
- Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA)
- Measurement and Analysis (MA)
- Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR)
- Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR)

## SCAMPI Appraisal

Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement:

**Appraisal Types**:
- Class A: Full benchmark appraisal
- Class B: Mid-range assessment
- Class C: Quick look or self-assessment

**Appraisal Process**:
1. Plan and prepare
2. Conduct appraisal
3. Review findings
4. Report results

**Outputs**:
- Maturity level rating
- Process capability profiles
- Findings and weaknesses
- Improvement recommendations

---

## Implementation

**Typical Approach**:
1. Executive commitment
2. Process improvement team
3. Gap analysis (current vs. target)
4. Process definition and deployment
5. Training and adoption
6. Measurement and monitoring
7. Appraisal
8. Continuous improvement

**Timeline**:
- Level 2: 12-18 months
- Level 3: Additional 12-18 months
- Levels 4-5: 2-3 years each

---

## Benefits

- Improved predictability
- Higher productivity
- Reduced defects
- Better cost estimation
- Enhanced customer satisfaction
- Competitive advantage

---

## Challenges

- High implementation cost
- Significant time investment
- Cultural change required
- Can be perceived as bureaucratic
- Maintenance effort

---

## CMMI for Agile

CMMI and Agile are complementary:

**Agile provides**:
- Delivery speed
- Customer collaboration
- Adaptive planning

**CMMI provides**:
- Process discipline
- Organizational learning
- Capability maturity

Can be integrated through:
- Agile as process at Level 2/3
- Sprint retrospectives for improvement
- Lightweight documentation
- Automation and CI/CD
