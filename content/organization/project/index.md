# Project Quality Management

Quality at the project level means ensuring that individual software projects meet their quality objectives through systematic planning, monitoring, and control. This subsection covers how to integrate quality into project management practices.

---

## Overview

Project quality management involves:

- **Planning quality** - Defining what quality means for this specific project
- **Managing quality** - Executing quality assurance processes
- **Controlling quality** - Monitoring results and taking corrective action

Unlike organizational quality (which focuses on long-term capability), project quality focuses on delivering a specific product that meets defined requirements and stakeholder expectations.

## Topics in This Section

### [Quality Planning](planning.md)

How to plan quality into projects from the start:

- Defining project-specific quality objectives
- Identifying quality activities and schedules
- Allocating resources for quality
- Creating quality management plans
- Establishing quality baselines

### [Quality Goals](goals.md)

Setting and tracking SMART quality objectives:

- Aligning quality goals with business objectives
- Making goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound
- Cascading organizational goals to projects
- Balancing competing quality attributes
- Communicating goals to stakeholders

### [Quality Metrics](metrics.md)

Measuring and reporting project quality:

- Selecting appropriate quality metrics
- Tracking defect trends
- Monitoring test effectiveness
- Reporting quality status to stakeholders
- Using metrics for decision-making

## Key Principles

### Quality is Part of the Iron Triangle

The traditional project management triangle of scope, time, and cost must include quality as a constraint. Cutting quality to save time or cost creates technical debt.

### Plan-Do-Check-Act

Use the PDCA cycle at the project level:

1. **Plan** - Define quality standards and activities
2. **Do** - Execute quality processes
3. **Check** - Measure and monitor results
4. **Act** - Improve based on lessons learned

### Quality Gates

Establish checkpoints where quality must meet defined criteria before proceeding:

- Requirements review gate
- Design review gate
- Code review gate
- Test completion gate
- Release readiness gate

## Project Quality Lifecycle

Quality activities span the entire project lifecycle:

**Initiation**

- Define quality objectives
- Identify stakeholder quality expectations
- Establish success criteria

**Planning**

- Develop quality management plan
- Define quality standards and processes
- Plan verification and validation activities
- Allocate quality budget and resources

**Execution**

- Conduct code reviews
- Perform testing activities
- Track quality metrics
- Implement quality assurance processes

**Monitoring and Control**

- Measure quality performance
- Analyze defect trends
- Take corrective actions
- Report quality status

**Closing**

- Conduct quality retrospectives
- Document lessons learned
- Archive quality artifacts
- Assess quality outcomes

## Integration with Project Management

Quality management integrates with other project management knowledge areas:

- **Scope Management** - Quality of requirements, acceptance criteria
- **Schedule Management** - Time allocated for quality activities
- **Cost Management** - Budget for testing, reviews, tools
- **Risk Management** - Quality risks and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Management** - Skills needed for quality assurance
- **Communications** - Quality status reporting
- **Stakeholder Management** - Managing quality expectations

---

## Common Project Quality Challenges

**Challenge**: Pressure to cut testing to meet deadlines

**Solution**: Make quality part of "done," use risk-based testing, automate regression tests

**Challenge**: Unclear quality acceptance criteria

**Solution**: Use acceptance test-driven development, define explicit quality gates

**Challenge**: Insufficient quality resources

**Solution**: Build quality into process (shift-left), automate where possible, use risk-based allocation
