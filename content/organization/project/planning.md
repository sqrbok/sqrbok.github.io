# Quality Planning

Quality planning is the process of identifying quality requirements and standards for the project and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance. It establishes the quality framework for the entire project.

---

## What is Quality Planning?

Quality planning answers fundamental questions:

- What does "quality" mean for this project?
- What quality standards apply?
- How will we measure quality?
- What quality activities will we perform?
- Who is responsible for quality?
- When will quality activities occur?
- What resources do we need for quality?

## Key Topics

### Quality Management Plan

Components of a comprehensive quality management plan:

- Quality objectives and success criteria
- Quality standards and compliance requirements
- Quality roles and responsibilities
- Quality processes and procedures
- Verification and validation approach
- Quality metrics and measurement
- Quality tools and techniques
- Quality schedule and milestones
- Quality budget and resources

### Quality Standards

Identifying applicable standards:

- Industry standards (ISO, IEEE, etc.)
- Organizational standards
- Regulatory requirements
- Customer-specific standards
- Coding standards
- Documentation standards
- Testing standards

### Quality Baselines

Establishing quality baselines:

- Scope baseline (quality of requirements)
- Schedule baseline (time for quality activities)
- Cost baseline (budget for quality)
- Performance baseline (quality metrics targets)

### Quality Activities

Planning verification and validation:

- Requirements reviews
- Design reviews
- Code reviews and inspections
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing
- Usability testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### Resource Allocation

Allocating resources for quality:

- Testing team sizing
- Review time allocation
- Tool licenses and infrastructure
- Training and skill development
- External audit or certification costs

## Planning Techniques

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Including quality work packages:

- Review activities
- Testing cycles
- Defect fixing time
- Quality audits
- Documentation

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Analyzing quality investments:

- Prevention vs. appraisal vs. failure costs
- ROI of automated testing
- Value of code reviews
- Cost of technical debt

### Benchmarking

Using historical data:

- Defect rates from similar projects
- Testing effort percentages
- Review effectiveness metrics
- Industry benchmarks

## Best Practices

1. **Plan quality early** - Don't wait until testing phase
2. **Involve stakeholders** - Get agreement on quality criteria
3. **Be specific** - Vague quality goals lead to disputes
4. **Make it measurable** - Define how you'll know quality is achieved
5. **Allocate realistically** - Budget 20-40% of project effort for quality
6. **Document assumptions** - Be explicit about quality constraints
7. **Plan for continuous improvement** - Include retrospectives and lessons learned

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Planning quality as an afterthought
- Underestimating time and cost for quality
- Copying quality plans from other projects without customization
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Not defining clear acceptance criteria
- Failing to get stakeholder buy-in on quality standards
