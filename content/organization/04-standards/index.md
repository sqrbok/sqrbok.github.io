# Quality Standards

Frameworks and certifications that provide structured approaches to quality management and process improvement.

## Why Standards Matter

Standards provide:

- **Common vocabulary** - Shared language for discussing quality
- **Best practices** - Distilled wisdom from industry experience
- **Benchmarking** - Ability to compare against peers
- **Certification** - External validation of capabilities
- **Contractual requirements** - Many customers require certification

## Choosing a Standard

## Key Principles

1. **Standards are guides, not prescriptions** - Adapt to your context
2. **Certification is not the goal** - Focus on actual improvement
3. **Start where you are** - Assess current state before planning
4. **Integrate, don't replace** - Standards complement existing practices
