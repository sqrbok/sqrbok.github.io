# Quality Planning

Quality planning ensures that quality activities are systematically designed, scheduled, and resourced rather than treated as an afterthought.

---

## Why Quality Planning?

> "Why do we put emphasis on a quality plan? Because in most situations quality is an afterthought."

Without planning:
- Quality activities get "easily tossed aside as deadlines loom"
- Testing is squeezed at the end of the schedule
- Defects are found late when they're expensive to fix
- Resources aren't available when needed

## Quality Planning Process

```
1. Determine what to do
        ↓
2. Estimate effort and lead times
        ↓
3. Coordinate with development plan
        ↓
4. Organize activities
        ↓
5. Document the plan
```

## Key Principles

1. **Plan early** - Quality planning starts in project initiation, not testing phase
2. **Integrate with development** - Quality activities must align with development schedule
3. **Adjust for criticality** - Higher-risk systems need more rigorous V&V
4. **Document decisions** - Explicit decisions prevent misunderstandings
