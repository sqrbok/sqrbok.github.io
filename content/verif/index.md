# Verification and Validation

Ensuring software quality requires rigorous verification and validation (V&V) activities. These techniques help detect defects, measure quality, and build confidence that software meets its requirements and user needs.

---

## V&V: What's the Difference?

### Verification
> "Are we building the product right?"

**Verification** checks whether software conforms to its specifications:
- Does the implementation match the design?
- Does the design satisfy the requirements?
- Are we following standards and processes correctly?

### Validation
> "Are we building the right product?"

**Validation** checks whether software meets user needs and expectations:
- Does the software solve the actual problem?
- Will users be satisfied with the solution?
- Does it provide value in the real world?

---

## Why V&V Matters

Software defects are expensive and dangerous:
- **Cost escalation**: Defects found in production cost 100x more to fix than those caught early
- **Safety risks**: In critical systems (medical, automotive, aerospace), defects can be fatal
- **Business impact**: Quality issues damage reputation, lose customers, and reduce revenue
- **Maintenance burden**: Poor quality code becomes harder and more expensive to maintain

**Prevention is cheaper than cure** - investing in V&V activities early saves time and money later.

## Testing Approaches

### Black Box Testing (Functional)
Testing based on requirements and specifications without knowledge of internal structure:
- Focus on inputs, outputs, and behavior
- Tests what the software does, not how it does it
- Examples: Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, use case testing

### White Box Testing (Structural)
Testing based on internal code structure and logic:
- Focus on paths, conditions, and control flow
- Tests how the software implements functionality
- Examples: Statement coverage, branch coverage, path testing

### Static Analysis
Examining code without executing it:
- Code reviews and inspections
- Automated tools (linters, type checkers, static analyzers)
- Detect issues early, before runtime

## Testing Levels

Software testing occurs at multiple levels:

1. **Unit Testing** - Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing** - Testing interactions between components
3. **System Testing** - Testing the complete integrated system
4. **Acceptance Testing** - Validating software meets user needs

---

## Key Principles

1. **Testing shows presence of defects, not absence** - You can't test quality in; you must build it in
2. **Early testing saves time and money** - Shift-left: test as early as possible
3. **100% coverage is impossible** - Focus on risk-based testing
4. **Pesticide paradox** - Running the same tests repeatedly finds fewer new bugs
5. **Context matters** - Testing approach depends on criticality, domain, and constraints
6. **Automate when possible** - Automated tests enable continuous quality feedback

---

## Test Adequacy

How do you know when you've tested enough?

Coverage criteria provide objective measures:
- Structural coverage (statements, branches, paths covered)
- Functional coverage (requirements, features tested)
- Mutation score (test suite effectiveness)

But adequacy also depends on:
- **Risk** - Critical functionality needs more testing
- **Cost** - Balance testing investment with value
- **Time** - Testing under deadlines requires prioritization
