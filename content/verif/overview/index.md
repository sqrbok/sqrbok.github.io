# Verification and Validation Overview

Software verification and validation (V&V) encompasses all activities that help ensure software quality through systematic examination and testing. This section provides a comprehensive overview of V&V techniques, their purposes, and when to apply them.

---

## V&V Landscape

V&V activities can be categorized along multiple dimensions:

### Static vs. Dynamic
- **Static**: Examine software without executing it (code reviews, inspections, static analysis)
- **Dynamic**: Execute software and observe behavior (testing at all levels)

### Manual vs. Automated
- **Manual**: Human-driven (code reviews, exploratory testing)
- **Automated**: Tool-driven (unit tests, static analyzers, linters)

### Black Box vs. White Box
- **Black box**: Based on specifications, no knowledge of internals
- **White box**: Based on code structure and implementation

## The V&V Spectrum

Different V&V techniques offer different trade-offs:

| Technique | Cost | Defect Detection | When to Use |
|-----------|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Code Review** | Low-Medium | High (design, logic) | Always, especially for critical code |
| **Static Analysis** | Low | Medium (patterns, bugs) | Continuously, automated in CI/CD |
| **Unit Testing** | Medium | High (logic, edge cases) | All code, TDD approach |
| **Integration Testing** | Medium | High (interfaces, interactions) | Component boundaries |
| **System Testing** | High | Medium-High (end-to-end) | Before release |
| **Acceptance Testing** | High | High (requirements) | Validate with users |

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Use multiple complementary V&V techniques. No single approach catches all defects.

### 2. Shift Left
Test and verify early in the development lifecycle. Defects are exponentially cheaper to fix when caught early.

### 3. Automate Where Possible
Automated V&V provides fast feedback and enables continuous quality.

### 4. Focus on Risk
Allocate V&V effort based on criticality, complexity, and change rate.

### 5. Balance Cost and Benefit
100% verification is impossible and uneconomical. Optimize for value.

## When to Use What?

### Use Static Analysis When:
- You want fast, automated feedback
- Looking for common bug patterns
- Enforcing coding standards
- Checking types and interfaces

### Use Code Reviews When:
- Design and architecture matter
- Domain knowledge is critical
- Catching subtle logic errors
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing

### Use Testing When:
- Verifying behavior and requirements
- Exercising runtime conditions
- Checking integration and interactions
- Validating performance and security

### Use Inspection When:
- Code is critical or complex
- More thorough review is needed
- Formal process is required
- Learning from defects is important

## Complementary Techniques

The most effective V&V programs combine techniques:

**Example: Critical Safety-Critical Module**
1. Static analysis for common bugs and standard violations
2. Code review for design and logic
3. Unit tests for behavior and edge cases
4. Integration tests for interactions
5. Formal inspection for final verification

**Example: Routine Business Logic**
1. Static analysis in CI/CD
2. Peer review via pull requests
3. Unit tests (TDD approach)
4. Integration tests for key flows
