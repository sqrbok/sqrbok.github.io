# White Box vs. Black Box Testing

## What Is White Box Testing?

White box testing (also known as structural or glass-box testing) involves examining the internal structure or workings of an application. The tester has knowledge of the source code and uses this to design test cases.

### Key Points:

* **Focus**: What is written (the code), not just what was intended (the specification).
* **Advantage**: Allows testers to design inputs that execute specific code paths, helping to discover hidden issues.
* **Purpose**:

  * Ensure all code paths are tested.
  * Discover unreachable or redundant code.
  * Find logic errors early in development.

### Characteristics:

* Can assess untested code features.
* Doesn't tell how well requirements are tested.
* Effective in early development stages.
* Typically performed by developers.

### Example (Fortran-style pseudocode):

```fortran
IF A THEN
    S1
ELSE
    S2
ENDIF

IF B THEN
    S3
ELSE
    S4
ENDIF
```

#### Diagram – White Box Testing Logic Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph WhiteBox["White Box"]
        direction TB
        
        A{Decision: A?} -->|True| S1[Statement S1]
        A -->|False| S2[Statement S2]
        S2 -->B
        S1-->B
        B{Decision: B?} -->|True| S3[Statement S3]
        B -->|False| S4[Statement S4]
    end

    Input1["Input A"] --> WhiteBox
    Input2["Input B"] --> WhiteBox

    WhiteBox --> Output1["Output X"]
    WhiteBox --> Output2["Output Y"]
```

### White Box Testing Strategies:

* Execute **all code statements** at least once.
* Execute **both true and false paths** of each decision.
* Traverse all **independent execution paths**.

To test effectively, inputs must be crafted to trigger specific code paths. If inputs are chosen only based on requirements, some code might go untested. If chosen only based on code, some requirements might not be validated.

## What Is Black Box Testing?

Black box testing focuses on verifying the software’s functionality based on its specifications, without considering the internal code structure.

### Key Points:

* **Focus**: What the system is supposed to do, based on specifications.
* **Advantage**: Doesn't require knowledge of the internal code.
* **Purpose**:

  * Ensure the system meets the stated requirements.
  * Detect missing or incorrect functionality.

### Characteristics:

* Anyone (testers, users, domain experts) can design test cases.
* Code coverage isn't visible from the tests.
* Effective in system and acceptance testing.

#### Diagram – Black Box Testing Concept

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph BlackBox["Black Box"]
        direction TB
        Spec["Specification f(x, y, ...)"]
    end

    Input1["Input 1"] --> BlackBox
    Input2["Input 2"] --> BlackBox
    Input3["Input 3"] --> BlackBox

    BlackBox --> Output1["Output 1"]
    BlackBox --> Output2["Output 2"]
    BlackBox --> Output3["Output 3"]
```

### Black Box Testing Strategies:

* Test based on:

  * **Typical values**
  * **Boundary values**
  * **Invalid inputs**
  * **Combinations of data**
* Each function should:

  * Do what it’s supposed to.
  * Not do what it shouldn’t.

## More Black Box Techniques

### Exploratory Testing

An unscripted approach where testers explore the software based on their intuition, experience, and understanding of the application.

#### Useful When:

* Formal specifications are missing or incomplete.
* The system is evolving and testers need to adapt quickly.

#### Limitations:

* **Lack of repeatability**: Different testers may explore different paths.
* **Risk of missed coverage**: Without structure, some features may be left untested.

#### Types:

* **Ad-hoc Testing**: Informal, based purely on experience.
* **Session-Based Testing**: Structured sessions with specific goals, followed by debriefing.
