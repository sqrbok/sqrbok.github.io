## 🛠️ Methods and Approaches

### 🔍 Static Analysis

- Works **directly on source code**.
    
- Detects basic but important properties.
    
- Examples:
    
    - `lint`, `FindBugs`, `SonarQube`, `CodeQL`, `CodeSense`
        

### 🔄 Model Checking

- Exhaustively explores all possible states (like brute force).
    
- Mostly **automated**, but model creation is manual.
    
- Example: **SPIN**
    

### 🧠 Theorem Proving

- Uses mathematical logic to **prove correctness**.
    
- Requires **expert human guidance**.
    
- Suitable for very critical systems.
