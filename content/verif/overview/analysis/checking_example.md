## Model Checking Example: Locking Discipline
  
  _Reference: G. Holzmann, Software Analysis and Model Checking {% cite holzmann2002checking %}_

We aim to verify whether a piece of code respects the _normal locking discipline_. Violations of this discipline can cause concurrency errors. According to this discipline, a single thread must **not**:

1. Attempt to **lock** a resource it already holds.
    
2. Attempt to **unlock** a resource it does **not** currently hold.
    
3. **Terminate** execution while still holding a lock.
    

This type of analysis is typically performed using **model checking**, a formal method used to systematically explore the states of a system.

## Code Under Analysis

We analyze the following C code:

```c
// Example from "Software Analysis and Model Checking" by G. Holzmann
do {
    lock(&devExt->writeListLock); // S0

    nPacketsOld = nPackets;
    request = devExt->WriteListHeadVa;

    if (request && request->status) { // S1
        devExt->WriteListHeadVa = request->nxt;
        unlock(&devExt->writeListLock); // S2
        nPackets++;
    }

} while (nPackets != nPacketsOld); // S3

unlock(&devExt->writeListLock); // S4
```

### Control Flow Representation

```mermaid

  S0["S0: lock(&devExt->writeListLock)"] --> S1["S1: if (request && request->status)"]
  S1 -- "true" --> S2["S2: unlock(&devExt->writeListLock)"]
  S1 -- "false" --> S3["S3: while (nPackets != nPacketsOld)"]
  S2 --> S3
  S3 -- "true" --> S0
  S3 -- "false" --> S4["S4: unlock(&devExt->writeListLock)"]
```

## Property to be Verified: Locking Discipline

We model the allowed states of a lock as a **finite state machine** (FSM). This model contains three states:

- `P0`: Unlocked
    
- `P1`: Locked
    
- `P2`: Error (violation of locking discipline)
    

```mermaid
stateDiagram
  [*] --> P0
  P0 --> P1 : lock
  P1 --> P0 : unlock
  P1 --> P2 : lock (error)
  P0 --> P2 : unlock (error)
  P2 --> P2 : lock/unlock (error)

  state "P0" as P0
  note right of P0: Unlocked

  state "P1" as P1
  note right of P1: Locked

  state "P2" as P2
  note right of P2: Error state
  style P2 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px
```

## Product Automaton: Combining FSM with Code

We now combine the control flow of the code with the locking FSM into a _product automaton_. This lets us track both the control state of the program and the lock state.

```mermaid
stateDiagram
  [*] --> P0S0

  P0S0 --> P1S1 : nPackets == nPacketsOld => lock
  P1S1 --> P1S2 : (request && request->status) => true
  P1S2 --> P0S3
  P0S3 --> P0S0 : nPackets != nPacketsOld (Always false)
  P0S3 --> P2S4 : unlock (error)

  P1S1 --> P1S3 : !(request && request->status) => false
  P1S3 --> P0S4 : unlock
  P1S3 --> P1S0 : nPackets != nPacketsOld (Always true)

  P1S0 --> P2S1 : lock (error)
  P2S1 --> P2S2
  P2S2 --> P2S3 : unlock
  P2S3 --> P1S0
  P2S3 --> P2S4 : unlock (error)

  style P2S4 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px
  style P2S1 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px
  style P2S2 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px
  style P2S3 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px
  style P1S0 fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:2px

```

## Analysis and Interpretation

- **Start State**: `P0` (Unlocked)
    
- **Accepting Final State**: `P0S4` (correct termination)
    
- **Error State**: `P2` (any transition here is a violation)
    

### Key Concepts

- **Accepting Runs**: All correct runs must start and end in `P0`. Ending in `P2` indicates a violation.
    
- **Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**:
    
    - `C1 = { P0S0, P1S1, P1S2, P0S3 }` → valid execution paths
        
    - `C2 = { P2S0, P2S1, P2S2, P2S3, P2S4 }` → invalid, leads to or stays in error state
        

### Violations

- Any finite execution path from `P0S0` to `P2S4` indicates a **violation** of the locking discipline.
    
- Any infinite path that visits `P2S1` also violates the discipline.

## Essence

This example illustrates how **model checking** and **finite state machines** can be used to detect violations of locking protocols in concurrent software. By abstracting the program and modeling its behavior formally, we can systematically verify properties like proper locking and resource management—critical for ensuring reliability in multi-threaded applications.
