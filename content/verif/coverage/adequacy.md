# Adequacy Criteria & Coverage

In software testing, **coverage** and **adequacy criteria** help us measure how thoroughly a test suite exercises an application. Under the assumption that more thorough testing uncovers more faults, we use these metrics to guide test planning, execution, and assess when to stop.

---

## 1. What Is Coverage?

> **Coverage** is a quantitative measure of how much of a particular artifact (code, inputs, requirements, etc.) has been exercised by tests.

* A higher coverage percentage generally (but not always) indicates a lower chance of undiscovered bugs.
* **Pitfall:** Running many tests that all cover the same code or scenarios yields little additional value.

---

## 2. Adequacy Criteria

An **adequacy criterion** defines *what* must be achieved by a test suite. It is often used to:

1. **Generate** test cases (by targeting untested elements).
2. **Measure** existing tests (by computing what percentage of the criterion is covered).
3. **Stop** testing (once a target coverage level or budget is reached).

---

## 3. White-Box (Structural) Coverage Criteria

These criteria examine the *internal* code structure to ensure different parts of the source have been exercised:

| Criterion                        | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Statement Coverage**           | Every executable statement is run at least once.                         |
| **Branch Coverage**              | Every branch (true/false path) of each control statement is taken.       |
| **Basis-Path Coverage**          | All independent paths through the control-flow graph are exercised.      |
| **Definition-Use (DU) Coverage** | For each variable definition, every corresponding use is tested.         |
| **Mutation Coverage**            | All injected faults (“mutants”) are detected (killed) by the test suite. |

> **Mutation testing** subdivides into:
>
> * **Strong mutation**: Test must cause different final output than original.
> * **Firm mutation**: Test must change some internal state.
> * **Weak mutation**: Test must detect the mutant immediately after the mutated statement.

## 4. Black-Box (Specification-Based) Coverage Criteria

These criteria focus on the *external* behavior of the system as defined by requirements or specifications:

| Criterion                              | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All Combinations of *n* Parameters** | Every unique combination of *n* input parameters is tested (often pairwise). |
| **N-Switch Coverage**                  | All sequences of *n* events, inputs, or states are exercised.                |
| **Equivalence Partitioning**           | Each equivalence class of inputs (assumed to behave the same) is tested.     |
| **Boundary Value Analysis**            | Inputs at or near the edges of valid ranges are tested.                      |
| **State-Based Coverage**               | All relevant state transitions in a state machine are tested.                |
| **Negative Testing**                   | Invalid or unexpected inputs to verify graceful failure.                     |

## 5. Applying Coverage Beyond Testing

Coverage metrics can be applied to any verification activity or artifact, for example:

* **Source code**: statement, branch, path coverage
* **Input space**: grammar-based or combinatorial coverage
* **Requirements**: which requirements have associated test cases
* **Test models**: coverage of use-case or sequence-diagram elements
* **GUI**: coverage of screens, buttons, and user flows
* **Exploratory testing**: session-based charters covered

> Even **exploratory testing** can be assessed by logging which areas (code, features, or scenarios) were explored.

## 6. How Coverage Is Used in Practice

1. **Test-case generation**

   * *Research approach*: Automatically generate inputs to satisfy coverage criteria.
   * *Industry approach*: Manually or semi-automatically create tests, then measure coverage to find gaps.

2. **Progress tracking and stopping rule**

   * Decide to stop when a target coverage level (e.g., 80% statement, 70% branch) or budget/time limit is reached.

3. **Risk management**

   * Low coverage in critical modules or requirements highlights areas needing more focus.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* **Coverage ≠ Quality**, but it’s a useful proxy: higher coverage usually correlates with finding more bugs.
* **Balance** structural and specification-based criteria to cover both *how* the code works and *what* it should do.
* Use coverage metrics to **guide**, **measure**, and **justify** your testing effort—not as the sole goal.

## Non-exhaustive list of adequacy criteria

LCSAJ – Linear Code Sequence and Jump
MC/DC – Modified Condition/Decision Coverage
DU – Definition Use pairs


Only in the case where we keep other things unchanged adequacy/coverage will measure test effectiveness. In general adequacy/coverage are a measure of the thoroughness of the testing.

A criterion C1 includes (or subsumes) the criterion C2 if for every program P and its specification S, any set of test cases that satisfy C1 also satisfy C2. This relation is represented as C1=> C2, and is a transitive  relation. 

One may think that if C1 => C2, testing based on C1 will always be better than testing based on C2. This is not the case because the fault-detection capability of a set of test cases T that satisfy a criterion C depends on the actual test cases in T and not just C (i.e., the criterion is not valid). In other words, if Ti and T2 both  satisfy C for a program does not imply that T1 and T2 will execute the same paths of P and detect the same faults in P. Because the actual test cases also play a role in whether or not an error in a program is detected, in general, it is possible to have a situation where Ci => C2, Ti satisfies Ci, T2 satisfies C2, but T2 detects an error that Ti does not. However, if similar methods are used for test case generation then, generally speaking, Ci will be better for testing than C2 if Ci =^ C2.

## Adequacy criteria selection

Purpose of the testing activity
Source code availability and relevance
Targeted faults (underlying fault model)
Compliance requirements


## Criteria hierarchy

In general, the higher in the hierarchy the criteria, the more thorough the testing. 
It is possible however, to have a situation where Ci subsumes Cj, Ti satisfies Ci, Tj satisfies Cj, but Tj detects an error that Ti does not

Criteria i : Branch coverage
Test suite i : a = 0; a = 2

Criteria j : Statement coverage
Test suite j : a = 1
